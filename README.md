# MockPacket
A Python-based network traffic generator designed for security researchers and digital forensics practitioners. This tool programmatically "forges" valid PCAP files by downloading real-world image data and encapsulating it into a TCP/IP stack.

MockPacket is essentially a "Network Simulator in a Box." Instead of having to open a browser and capture traffic with Wireshark manually, it "hand-crafts" the traffic from scratch.
